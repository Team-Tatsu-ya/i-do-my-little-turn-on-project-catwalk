# I Do My Little Turn on Project Catwalk

> I Do My Little Turn on Project Catwalk (hereafter simply Project Catwalk) aims to revitalize an online apparel retail presence using front-end technologies in the JavaScript stack. Project Catwalk immediately features robust product detail pages, including images & descriptions, ratings & reviews, and related items & outfit-building components for an interactive and user-friendly shopping experience, while also optimizing for performance. Other components (such as homepage and cart pages) are deferred to future release -- 'cause we're in our scope, you know what I mean? And I Do My Little Turn on Project Catwalk.
